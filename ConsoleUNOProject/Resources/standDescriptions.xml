		<StandPowerDescription>
Golden Experience
Giorno transforms one of his Number Cards into a Special Card of his choice. 
After performing this action and placing the Special Card, 
if he is targeted by any action of other players in the next turn, 
the effects will be reversed back to the opponent.

and if he is targeted by another player on the next turn, 
the action performed by the opponent will keep reflecting back to him each turn for the rest of the match.

		<Name>Leone Abbacchio</Name>
		<StandPowerDescription>
Moody Blues
Leone revives a specific memory from the match, forcing a player, 
or himself, to redo the same play as before. This will happen as follows:
- If he says a player must redo some card placing, and the player doesnt have the same card in hand, 
the first player who has it, in a reverse clockwise direction from Leone, 
must give the card to the selected player so they can perform the same movement again when their next turn arrives, 
losing their original choice of movement. 
If no player has the required card, the target must buy a card from the draw pile. 
(This is considered a failed attempt to use the stand, but still has its uses...)
- If he chooses to repeat himself, he must have a card with the same color or number (or special effect) as the action he wants to repeat. If he does, he can place this card regardless of the card on the discard stack. (The same goes for the targeted player).

D4C (Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap)
Valentine opens a dimensional rift and jumps to a different dimension.
The following events will occur:
- In this new reality, the players have a different disposition. 
First, all players positions are shuffled, then, Valentines hand and the two players at his sides before the shuffle will have their hands randomly swapped between themselves.
- Each new jump will remove a card from Valentines hand and add it to a random player after the jump, unless he has two or fewer cards in hand.
- If he has 6 or more cards, the "Love Train" effect is triggered.
- For the next 3 turns, Valentine can place any card of any number or color. 
Additionally, any attack will be deflected to the two players with fewer cards in hand while this effect is active. (Love Train can only be activated once per match).

		<Name>Yoshikage Kira</Name>
		<StandPowerDescription>
Kira implants a bomb in a card and sends it to the draw pile. If a player buys that card, it has to buy another 3 cards.

Killer Queen Bites the Dust:

Bites the Dust activation will force the target player to buy 6 cards either from the draw pile, 
discard pile, or a card from each player in a counterclockwise direction until it makes 6 cards. 
Bites the Dust can only be activated once per round.

Kira selects a player. During this round Bites the Dust will be activated :
-If a player enters the UNO state, and announces it.
-If a player announces that another player hasn’t shouted UNO.
-If a player uses a stand power
-If a player places a Special Card

Bites the Dust effect can be reverted by any time reverting stand or reflecting/deflecting power.
If the victim has at least one Skip card, this can be used to nullify the stand effect.
(The Skip card must be discarded).
If player’s cards are being collected to make the 6 cards and a player would enter the UNO state by giving the card, 
he will be skipped of the cards collecting effect.
